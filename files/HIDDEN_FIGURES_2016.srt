00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,359
- Any day now.
- Yes, sir.

163
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,239
- What's it called? The initials.
- The IBM.

164
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,959
- International Business Machines.
- Space is a business. <font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font>

165
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,719
I need a mathematician.

166
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,539
- I'll put in another request, sir.
- "Another request." Jesus Christ.

167
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,719
We don't have a single person
in this entire building

168
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,199
that can handle analytic geometry?

169
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,459
That's what I've been told.

170
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,119
Well, tell me something else, Ruth,
like we're gonna find such a person

171
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,910
before the Russians plant
a flag on the damn moon.

172
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,919
A real good time.

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,039
Ladies, ladies.

176
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,899
If you're tardy, you don't get an assignment.

177
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,999
If you don't get an assignment,
you don't have a job.

178
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,619
Eleanor. Data Reduction, building 202.

179
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:45,079
- Data Reduction?
- Well, you're welcome to join the charmers

180
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,319
- in Magnetoplasma Dynamics.
- Oh, no, ma'am.

181
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,339
Thank you. Data Reduction is just fine.

182
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,863
Mm-hmm.

183
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,819
- Mary.
- Present.

184
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,419
The Mercury Seven prototype
has arrived for testing.

185
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,086
Mr. Zielinski's requesting you

186
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:01,939
for permanent assignment.

187
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,919
Are you serious?

188
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,730
Get moving.

189
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,799
Ooh, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus!

190
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,019
- Oh, thank you.
- Mary, Mary. Keep it inside.

191
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,822
Okay. I'm sorry, Dor.

192
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,539
All right, Mrs. Late. You will also
be supporting the east group.

193
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,479
Mrs. Mitchell.

194
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,099
We're on double-time this morning, girls.

195
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,599
I need these calculations before lunch.

196
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,299
Space Task Group needs a computer, ASAP.

197
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,879
Someone with a handle on analytic geometry.

198
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,779
We can't fill that position
out of the east group.

199
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,099
Permanent or temp?

200
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,119
Everything's temporary, Dorothy.

201
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,219
- You have someone?
- Yes, ma'am.

202
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,199
Katherine's the gal for that.

203
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,319
She can handle any numbers
you put in front of her.

204
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,649
<i>I'll check her credentials.</i>

205
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,619
Didn't think I'd come all the way down here.

206
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,810
- Here. Finish passing those out.

208
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,870
If I could...

209
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,999
My application for supervisor, ma'am.

210
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,399
Was just wondering if they're still
considering me for that position.

211
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,119
Yes. Well, the official word is no.

212
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,659
They're not assigning a permanent
supervisor for the colored group.

213
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,039
May I ask why?

214
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,719
I don't know why.

215
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,359
I didn't ask why.

216
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,279
We need a supervisor, ma'am.

217
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,659
We haven't had one since Miss Jansen
got sick. It's been almost a year.

218
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,639
- Things are working just fine as is.
- I'm doing the work of a supervisor.

219
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,799
Well, that's NASA for you.

220
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,919
Fast with rocket ships, slow with advancement.

221
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,062
Get those trajectory calcs worked out.
We need them for the Redstone test.

<i>If we alter the exterior from

the capsule might have more stability. But
the friction, it is under during re-entry...

236
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:36,639
Most shield erosion occurs on the posterior
side abutting the retro-boosters.

237
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,644
Conclusion?

238
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,603
The area closest to the boosters
is closest to the heat.

239
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:49,839
Coupled with rising temperature
on re-entry the contact softens.

240
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,569
We could consider another
fastener other than the bolts.

241
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,359
Yes.

242
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,765
Yes.

243
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,319
There is another opening in the
Engineer Training Program.

244
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,039
- Flat head rivets would reduce wind drag.
- Mary, a person with engineer's mind

245
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,519
should be an engineer. You can't be
a computer the rest of your life.

246
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,399
Mr. Zielinski...

247
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,159
I'm a Negro woman.

248
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,819
- I'm not gonna entertain the impossible.
- And I'm a Polish Jew

249
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,079
whose parents died in a Nazi prison camp.

250
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:33,239
Now I'm standing beneath a spaceship that's
going to carry an astronaut to the stars.

251
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,579
I think we can say we are living the impossible.

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,039
if you were a white male,

254
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,679
would you wish to be an engineer?

255
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,519
I wouldn't have to. I'd already be one.

259
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,279
A simple pearl necklace is the exception.

260
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,199
Your supervisor is Mr. Al Harrison,

You'll write research, proof

Do not talk to Mr. Harrison
unless he talks to you.

264
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,039
Not many computers last more than a few days.
He's been through a dozen in as many months.

265
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,559
Come on, keep up. Things
move fast around here.

Take the desk in the back.
I'll get you work in a... bit.

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,322
Go on. Get settled.

281
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,719
Paul. Why are we still losing
shingles off the heat shield?

282
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,399
Uh... we're wor... working with
a prototype of the capsule, Al.

283
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,839
- Its lid is one third the size of what it's going...
<i><font color=#FF551>- AL:</font> I get that. So...</i>

284
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,879
what do we do with our million dollar fan, Karl?

285
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,599
- Turn it down?
- No, Al. I don't think...

286
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,979
It was a joke.

287
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,579
Paul, if the heat shield comes off...

288
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,150
- what do you think happens to our astronaut?
- I know.

289
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,159
So we're gonna... we're gonna
come up with a solve, right?

290
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,959
Yes, sir. We're working on it.

291
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,941
- Ruth, what's the status on that computer?
- She's right behind you, Mr. Harrison.

292
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,519
Does she handle Analytic Geometry?

293
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,559
Absolutely. And she speaks.

294
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,419
Yes, sir. I do.

295
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,719
- Which one?
- <i>Both.</i>

296
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,809
Geometry and speaking.

297
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,246
Ruth, uh... get me the...

298
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,459
You think you, uh...

299
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,639
You think you can find me the
Frenet frame for this data?

300
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,839
- Using the Gram-Schmidt...
- Orthogonalization algorithm. Yes, sir.

301
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,189
I prefer it over Euclidean coordinates.

302
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,849
Okay, good.

303
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,599
Good, then I'm gonna need
it by the end of the day.

304
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,439
Yes.

305
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,919
I'm also gonna ask you to
check Mr. Stafford's math

306
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,399
as well as others' on this
floor from time to time.

307
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,889
- I can... I can handle that, Al.
- I'm sure you can, Paul. I'm sure they all can.

308
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,439
But if that were the case

309
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,310
shingles wouldn't be flying off the
heat shield, now would they?

310
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,839
Excuse me, could I have everyone's
attention for a moment?

311
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,449
Thank you. Just uh...

312
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,199
Just to be clear in 14 days, the Mercury
Seven will be here for training.

313
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,999
And I have no doubt in my
mind that they're going to be

314
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,641
asking us questions about our work.

315
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:31,079
I think that's pretty reasonable

316
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,889
given we're putting a human on top
of a missile, shooting him into space,

317

649
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,420
Our runner can pick up your work, Dorothy.

650
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:51,759
- You need to be working, not walking.
- Oh, it's break time, ma'am. No trouble at all.

651
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,599

652
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,479
you can take that batch over there.

653
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,087
Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

654
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,519
- You need something else?
- Yes, ma'am. Um...

655
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,810
I was wondering if you know what they're
building over in the tech wing.

656
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,119
It's called an IBM.

657
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,319
A mainframe machine.

658
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,679
Apparently, it can do our calculations
in a fraction of the time.

659
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,279
Hmm.

660
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,062
I guess that's good for NASA.

661
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,586
Hurry on, now. Best if you do it in one trip.

What are you looking at, Paul?

666
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,323
Is that correct?

667
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,770
Yeah.

668
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,905
Whose work is that?

669
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,981
<i>I said, whose work is that?</i>

670
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,682
Katherine Goble, sir.

671
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,399
- Hello.
- Hi.

672
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,199
<i><font color=#FF551>PAUL: </font>How did you know the Redstone
couldn't support orbital flight?</i>

673
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,399
That's classified information.

674
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,039
It's top secret.

675
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,399
Well, it's no secret why the
Redstone tests keep failing.

676
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,839
It's fine for sub-orbital flight but it can't
handle the weight of the capsule

677
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,879
and push it into space.

678
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,079
- Numbers don't lie.
- And you figured all that out with this?

679
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,821
Half the data is redacted.

680
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:21,319
But what's there tells a story
if you read between the lines.

681
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,439
The distance from launch to orbit, we
know. Redstone mass, we know.

682
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,799
Mercury capsule weight, we know.

683
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,639
- And the speeds are there in the data.
- You did the math.

684
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,439
Yes, sir.

685
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,081
I looked beyond.

686
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,959
How do you know about the Atlas rocket?

687
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,919
That's not math.

688
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,996
That data is not here. Like
you said, it's classified.

689
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,639
- I held it up to the light.
- You held it up to the light?

690
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,319

691

- Well, there it is.
- Mmm-hmm.

692
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,199
Atlas.

693
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,279
- What's your name?
- Katherine Goble.

694
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,839
- Are you a spy, Katherine?
- Am I what?

695
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,639
- I said, are you a Russian spy?
- No, sir.

696
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,119
I'm not Russian.

697
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,268
She's not Russian, sir.

698
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,059
All right then, we have nothing to lose here.

699
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,519
Give her everything she needs to
work on Shepard's trajectories.

700
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,659
- Without redaction. Are we clear on that?
- But...

701
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,599
- are we sure about this?
- What's the issue, Paul? You heard her.

702
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,610
She's not a spy.

703
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,899
I ju... I... I just don't think it's a good idea.

704
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,339
You know what I think's
a good idea? Darker ink.

705
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,259
I think darker ink's a good idea.
Ruth, could you pass it along?

706
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,419

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,459

I wanna thank everyone for staying.

850
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,839
I know it's late. And after what I just saw,

851
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,919
I'm sure everyone's probably
anxious to just go home.

852
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,039
Before we do, I just have to ask a question.

853
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,839
The same one

854
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,525
I've been asking myself all the
way over here, which is...

855
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,879
How the hell did we find ourself in
second place in a two-man race?

856
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,990
Anybody?

857
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,690
Paul?

858
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,399
And I think Glenn said it pretty
well. They're just outworking us.

859
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,019
The reason I have to... think that
is because I refuse to believe

860
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,439
that the Russians are smarter than us
or that they have more technology,

861
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,763
or that they care more.

862
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,921
But I don't know. Is that possible?

863
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,043
Is it possible that it actually
means more to them?

864
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,979
We're in the fight of our lives, people.

865
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,559
We're not on some epic joy ride.

866
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:31,201
I just saw seven faces, who aren't
sure that we can get there.

867
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,527
This is our problem.

868
00:55:37,528 --> 00:55:40,283
And so as of right now

869
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,279
there's only two things you
need to know going forward.

870
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,119
One is staying here, working late,
that's gonna be a fact of life.

871
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,279
And two, don't expect your paychecks
to reflect the extra time it's gonna take

872
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,446
to catch up and pass those bastards.

873
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,959
For those of you who can't work that way,

874
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,279
I understand and thank
you for what you've done.

875
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,719

876
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,659
I suggest you call your wives

877
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:08,589

be. I'll start with mine.

Stafford, you understand?

1130
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,479
Yes, sir.

1131
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,759
Thank you.

1132
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,088

1141

01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,310
I can't, I can't. Mary.

1144
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,719
<i><font color=#FF551>SENATOR PATRICK:</font> Mr. Harrison,
taxpayer money sank into the ocean</i>

1145
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:54,199
along with your capsule. So what makes you
think you can bring John Glenn home safely?

1146
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,079
Let me say first...

1147
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:59,659
discovery is never just for the sake of discovery,
gentlemen, but for the sake of human survival.

1148
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:03,645
And... it will always come with a risk.

1149
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:09,439
Whoever gets there first will make the rules.
That's been true of every civilization, and so...

1150
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,599
<i>I think the bigger question
for this body to consider is...</i>

1151
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,919
<i>who do you want calling the shots in space?</i>

1152
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,641
We have to know what's out there, Senator.

1153
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:26,281
We have to touch the stars, if only to ensure
our own survival. And only a man can do that.

1154
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:31,219
We'll get John Glenn home
safely because we have to.

1155
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:34,325
Because he has to tell us what he saw.

1156
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,759
The Redstone rocket went straight up.

1157
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,830
But the capsule didn't have enough speed
to go into orbit, so it came back down.

1158
01:16:43,831 --> 01:16:47,479
Essentially a triangle. Earth, sub-orbit, Earth.

1159
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,279
That math was known.

1160
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,558
That took Shepard, took Grissom.

1161
01:16:52,559 --> 01:16:54,923
That cannot take Glenn.

1162
01:16:54,924 --> 01:16:57,479
Now, the Atlas rocket...

1163
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,439
that can push us into orbit.

1164
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:03,367
Goes up, delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit.

1165
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,319
Earth's gravity keeps pulling at it

1166
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,019
but it's going so fast, it
keeps missing the Earth.

1167
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,039
That's how it stays in orbit.

1168
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:15,562
Now, getting it back down that's
the math we don't know.

1169
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:17,999
Yes, Katherine.

1170
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,839
So the capsule will spin
around the Earth forever

1171
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,479
because there's nothing to slow it down?

1172
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:24,439
That's right.

1173
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:31,730
Slowing it down at precisely the right moment,
at precisely the right amount, that's the task.

1174
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,839
Yes, Katherine.

1175
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:39,799
So it needs to move from an elliptical orbit...

1176
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,890
- to a parabolic orbit.
- Yes.

1177
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,999
Th... that's the "Go/No-go".

1178
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,679
Now at this point, it's a pin head.

1179
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:52,159
- We bring him in too soon...
- He burns up on reentry.

1180
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,559
That's right.

1181
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:56,799
We bring him in too late he's
pushed out of Earth's gravity.

1182
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:04,446
And any changes to mass, weight, speed,
time, distance, friction, or a puff of wind...

1183
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:06,759
would alter the "Go/No-go".

1184
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:11,879
- And we start our calculations over.
- Yes.

1185
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:16,799
So we need to be able to
choose this reentry point.

1186
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,639
Now this "Go/No-go," this has to be exact. Sam.

1187
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,319
These are the latest Redstone
numbers in current capsule data.

1188
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,459
Obviously, we know the launch spot.

1189
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:29,879
- Thanks.
- A Pentagon briefing should illuminate

1190
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:34,399
where the Navy needs the recovery zone.
Then we work backwards from there.

1191
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:39,959
- And the rest is on us, so let's get to work.
- Uh, Mr. Stafford.

1192
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,999
What, Katherine?

1193
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,759
If I could attend the briefings, I'd
be more useful to the project.

1194
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,759
Pentagon briefings are closed door.

1195
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,679
Yes, but if we don't have the information

1196
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,359
of the changes... we... we can't keep up.

1197
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,959
I need those changes as they occur.
As you said, it's a pin head.

1198
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,519
Katherine, that's the job. You
asked for this assignment,

1199
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,759
so just calculate with what you have.

1200
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,826
Or we'll find someone who can.

1201
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,285
Okay.

1202
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,719
Atta girl. <font color=#ff00ff>[CHUCKLES]</font>

1203
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,159
What the hell are you doing?
You can't be in here.

1204
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,159
Who are you?

1205
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,119
I'm with the West Computing Group.

1206
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:35,599
- Dorothy Vaughan, sir.
- Well, this is a very delicate piece of equipment.

1207
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,399
I'm sorry, sir. I'm just trying to be helpful.

1208
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,740
<i><font color=#FF551>- BILL:</font> Uh-huh.
- Bill, we've got numbers.</i>

1209
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,528
What kind of numbers?

1210
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:49,779
Well, I'll be.

1211
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,159
What's your name again?

1212
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:57,423
- Dorothy Vaughan.
- Dorothy Vaughan.

1213
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,239
Sir, the parameters for Friendship 7.

1214
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,759
Oh, this is all moot.

1215
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,759
We're altering the window on the capsule.

1216
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,439
- When did this happen?
- Six minutes ago.

1217
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,999
The math is changing. Start over.

1218
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,439
Sir, if I could attend the briefings,
I could stay current...

1219
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,739
Katherine, we have been through
this. It is not possible.

1220
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:20,839
There is no protocol for women attending.

1221
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,399
There's no protocol for a man
circling the Earth either, sir.

1222
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,849
Okay. That is just the way things are.

1223
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,479
Colonel Glenn's launch coordinates,
accounting for the window change, sir.

1224
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,439
I have told you this. Computers
don't author reports. Fix it.

1225
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,919
Those are my calculations.
My name should be on it.

1226
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,799
That is not the way this works.

1227
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,919
Paul. What's happening here?

1228
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:15,639
Mr. Harrison, I would like
to attend today's briefing.

1229
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,719
And why is that?

1230
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,659
Well, Sir, the data changes so
fast. The capsule changes.

1231
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:22,919
The weight and the landing zones
are all changing, every day.

1232
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,239
I do my work, you attend these briefings,

1233
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,799
I have to start over.

1234
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,799
Colonel Glenn launches in a few weeks.
We don't have the math figured out yet.

1235
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,579
- Why is it she can't attend?
- Because she doesn't have clearance, Al.

1236
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:37,639
I cannot do my work effectively
if I do not have all of the data

1237
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,999
and all of the information
as soon as it's available.

1238
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,679
I need to be in that room,
hearing what you hear.

1239
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,439
Pentagon briefings are not for civilians.

1240
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,779
- It requires the highest clearance.
- I feel like I'm the best person

1241
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:46,919
to present my calculations...

1242
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,759
- You're not gonna let this go, are you?
- No, I am not.

1243
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:51,159
And... and she is a woman. There is no protocol

1244
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,589
- for a woman attending these meetings.
- Okay, I get that part, Paul.

1245
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:02,359
- But within these walls, who makes the rules?
- You, sir. You are the boss.

1246
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:05,809
You just have to act like one. Sir.

1247
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,319
You keep quiet.

1248
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,279
Thank you.

1249
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,899
Good morning.

1250
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,719

1253
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:34,885
This is Katherine Goble with our Trajectory
and Launch Window division.

1254
01:22:34,886 --> 01:22:38,639
Her work is pertinent to today's proceedings.

1255
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,250
Come on.

1256
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,884
<i>Wanna get her a chair?</i>

1257
01:22:43,685 --> 01:22:44,999
We have a confirmed launch window...

1258
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,479
- Get her a chair, please.
- Yes, sir.

1259
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:50,559
We have a confirmed launch window for
Friendship 7. Let's discuss a landing zone.

1260
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,039
The Navy needs a singular landing zone.

1261
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,519
20 miles square is what we
can service for retrieval.

1262
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,559
Outside of that, we risk the capsule's recovery.

1263
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:03,039
- We'd like three possible recovery areas.
- We can't cover half the damn ocean.

1264
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,808
With all due respect, our
capsule's being altered daily.

1265
01:23:06,809 --> 01:23:10,005
We're orbiting the Earth at what speed now?

1266
01:23:10,006 --> 01:23:12,010
Uh...

1267
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,119
17,544 miles per hour...

1268
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:22,884
at the time the rocket delivers
the capsule into low space orbit.

1269
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,079
- Well, that's one hell of a speeding ticket.
<font color=#ff00ff>- [ALL LAUGH]</font>

1270
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,119
Okay.

1271
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,919
So we have the vehicle's speed,
the launch window and...

1272
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,079
for argument's sake, the landing
zone is the Bahamas.

1273
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,599
- Should be enough to figure the "Go/No-go"?
- Yeah, in theory, sir.

1274
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,119
- We need to be past theory at this point.
- We'll be able to calculate a "Go/No-go"

1275
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:47,319
- with that information.
- When exactly is that gonna happen?

1284
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:40,080

1292

is when the capsule moves from an
elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit.

1369

There's no mathematical formula for that.

1370

Because we can calculate launch and
landing but without this conversion
